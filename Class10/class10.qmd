## The PDB database

The main repository of biomelecular structure data is called the PDK found at: http://www.rcsb.org/ 


Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics> By Exp method and molecular type. 

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric.

I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the  `sub()` function:

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",","",x)))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function. 

```{r}
library(readr)

pdbstats <-read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats

```

I want to cclean the column names so they are all lower case and dont have spces in them

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```


```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df

```
Total number of x-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```
total number of structures

```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

Percent of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```
Percent of EM strucutes
```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total) * 100 
```
> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
rownames(df)

```

```{r}
sum(df$x_ray[1:3] + df$em[1:3] + df$nmr[1:3])/sum(df$total) * 100
```
The proportion that is protein is 97.77%

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

When put in the search bar there were said to be 4,683 stuctures 

## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at:https://molstar.org/viewer/ We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB databse accession code (4 letter code)

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
 
 This is because of the view and to save space. 

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

the residue number is 308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for strucural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
length(pdbseq)
```

Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1 

Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains A and B 

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol)` and `install.packags("shiny")`


```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink")
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics
We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules. 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion: 

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
